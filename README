Term/Twiddle version 2.51
=========================

DESCRIPTION

Term::Twiddle displays a little spinning baton (thingy) while
something else is going on. Its primary use is to give bored users
something to watch while some long routine is executing.

You can change the baton into something else (e.g., a pair of blinking
eyes, etc.), the rate at which it spins (or changes), randomize the
speed of the baton, and other such things.

EXAMPLE

    use Term::Twiddle;

    my $tw = new Term::Twiddle;

    ## do something
    $tw->start;

    ## while untar'ing, the baton is spinning
    system('tar', '-xf', 'some_big_tarfile.tar');

    $tw->stop;


    ## now do something else
    $tw->random;
    $tw->start;

    ## while executing, the baton changes speed randomly
    &some_long_subroutine();

    $tw->stop;
